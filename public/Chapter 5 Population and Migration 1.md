 - Modern humans evolved in Africa about 200,000 years ago
 - About 100,000 years ago, we began migrating across the globe
 - Our population remained low--probably less than 1 million people
 - With farming our growth increased a LOT
 - By AD 1, world population reached 170 million people

# How do the ideas — and importantly the data — in Rosling's talk show us the problems with a strict west/non-west, or developed/developing view of the world?

One problem he mentioned was that while a strict western developed view of the world is yearning for a vacation to a remote location, this worldview ignores the 2 billion people who have to worry about buying food or shoes for the day.

- 12,000 years ago there were 4.43 million people on earth
This is is so small to the 8 BILLION people we have on earth now. The big change seemed to have happened around 1600-1800 the industrial revolution.

# The video states that programs to lower child mortality and help poorer countries develop — that essentially help people on the other side of the globe live better lives — is the secret to the overpopulation problem. Why is this the case?

This is the secret to the overpopulation problem because as these poorer countries move out of stage one and into stage 2 and 3 the birthrate is still super high while the death rate is plummeting. This creates a period of time where the population has massive, explosive growth. This is the case because many parents of the population boom generation are still having 5-8 kids because its either what their parents did or they expected a lot of the children to die thus the high birthrate and low infant mortality rate.
