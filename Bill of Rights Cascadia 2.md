# Rights and Freedoms

### $\quad$I. Article 1 (Rights and Freedoms)


$\quad$Article 1a-1) **Freedom of Expression & Religion**

$\quad$$\quad$Freedom of expression is guaranteed in our nation to keep its people able to
speak out against unjust treatment, ensure cultural differences are protected, and
cultivate creativity and progress in our society. The government shall make no law
restricting how an individual expresses themselves except for cases where the form of
expression physically harms or threatens to harm individuals or property. While this may allow people to spread harmful, hateful, or false information it is vital that government only restrict expression when it is absolutely necessary. 

$\quad$$\quad$All religious and spiritual beliefs are protected and not restricted by the federal or state governments. This also includes the right to not profess any religion or belief, or
“not to practice a religion.”

$\quad$$\quad$This right was added to allow everyone to have an open discussion and we think
this is a human right. This may create division in society as individuals will have different
beliefs and ideas. With no set religion, these different beliefs and ideas can lead to
conflicts as morals and beliefs vary by religion. This is ranked number one because being
able to express oneself is the first step to identifying and discussing injustice.

$\quad$Article 1a-2) **Right to Equality**

$\quad$$\quad$Citizens of this confederacy are treated the same under law and public
institutions. Discrimination based on adapted state, gender, sexual orientation, ability,
nationality, and race are not permitted. It is understood that while people may be treated
equally this does not achieve equity.

$\quad$$\quad$Within this right, no individuals are restricted or discriminated against as this
right allows for the freedom of an individual without the worry of discrimination. This
right has the potential to conflict with the freedom of religion as in religions, some of
these freedoms mentioned are not allowed. This can once more create tension between
personal and religious beliefs. It also may come into conflict with the Freedom of
Expression if people claim to use their freedom of expression to express their desire to
discriminate. This is ranked second because it is particularly important in a
democratically elected government for all people to be treated equally under the law
because everyone’s vote is worth the same no matter who you are.

$\quad$Article 1a-3) **Right to Privacy**

$\quad$$\quad$The right to privacy protects individuals from unwarranted government intrusion
into their personal lives and choices, The right to privacy protects against unjust search
and seizure and other intrusions into someone's privacy without probable cause.

$\quad$$\quad$Included this right because all citizens should be able to expect a level of privacy.
This right does not discriminate against any individual as every citizen has the right to
privacy. The secondary effects of this law can lead to higher crime rates that can put the
well-being and safety of others at risk. This right is ranked 3rd to prevent government
tyranny and surveillance. If this right were ranked lower the government would see it as
less important and would make it more difficult for people to come together against the
government if necessary.

$\quad$Article 1a-4) **Right to Own Property**

$\quad$$\quad$The right to own property protects citizens from unjust government seizure of
personal property. The government shall have limited say on what you do with your
property and may only have the right to intervene when it endangers the public or
violates property type zoning laws.

$\quad$$\quad$Within this right, every person has the right to own personal property which is
protected against government seizure. No individual is restricted from buying and/or
owning property, however, everything comes with a price. If an individual cannot afford
the property, they may be restricted on what they can purchase effectively creating a
loser. Also, zoning laws may be used to restrict certain groups from creating businesses
where it would benefit them, which would also create a loser. This right is ranked 4th
because the right to own property is the choice to be more separated from the
government which is important for citizens who want freedom.

$\quad$Article 1a-5) **Right to Protect Property & Self**

$\quad$$\quad$The right to use proportional force upon another individual in self-defense to
protect oneself or another from bodily harm from an aggressor if there is a credible
threat or action against them or their property.

$\quad$$\quad$This right is included because it is a human right to protect yourself and others.
This right gives people the opportunity to defend themselves, others, and property from
damage. There must be sufficient evidence of a threat to use deadly force, thus creating
disadvantages. Also “proportional” force may be more subjective than intended and may
be prone to a prejudiced jury. This right is ranked 5th underneath the right to own
property so that you can protect yourself and the property you have the right to own.

$\quad$Article 1a-6) **Right to a Fair Trial**

$\quad$$\quad$Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent
and impartial tribunal, in the determination of their rights and obligations and of any
criminal charge against them. These include the rights to a public trial without
unnecessary delay, the right to a lawyer, and the right to know who your accusers are and
the nature of the charges and evidence against you.

$\quad$$\quad$The right to receive a fair trial restricts no individual as it is a right granted to
every citizen and non-citizen. With laws in place against discrimination of expression and
religion, the federal and state government cannot rule against this right. With every
citizen granted the right to a lawyer, this gives those who are uneducated in law an
opportunity to fight for their freedom and let their voice be heard in the court of law.
The right to a fair trial is ranked 6th higher than others because it is important in a
democracy to be treated fairly in a court of law.

$\quad$Article 1a-7) **Right to Education**

$\quad$$\quad$Education is vital to the success of an individual and society. The government is
required to provide adequate education to every citizen for free without bias or
favoritism. This however does not restrict states from creating privatized institutions.

$\quad$$\quad$Every citizen is granted educational opportunities no matter their financial
health. Having an educated society can bring more ideas to branch off from as well as
prepare those for careers utilizing higher education credentials. While certain institutions
remain free, this does not restrict states from creating private institutions revolving
around expression or religion. Richer citizens in the population may be able to afford
even better education perpetuating wealth inequality. Another way this could create
losers is by having public institutions be undermaintained or underfunded. The right to
education is ranked in the lower half of the rights because education is a choice and can
be replaced by private institutions.

$\quad$Article 1a-8) **Right to Water**

$\quad$$\quad$The right to water is considered a basic human right and a healthy nation with
access to clean drinking water leads to greater public health. The government shall not
restrict access to clean drinking water and shall provide access if there is none.

$\quad$$\quad$Every citizen is granted the opportunity to receive potable water by the
government. A potential problem that could arise can be seen with those living outside
of city limits. With no waterlines designed to reach these people, they are nearly forced
to build wells for their water sources. With a well, an individual cannot restrict access to
other individuals which could lead to unreliable water sources as the wells could run dry
as they are not designed to have multiple individuals using them. The right to water is
ranked lower because it can be easily replaced by private interests because the demand
for water will always be there. Although government regulated safe drinking water is
likely to be better.

$\quad$Article 1a-9) **Right to Access Healthcare**

$\quad$$\quad$Access to healthcare is a fundamental human right, and the government shall not
impede an individual from accessing any form of healthcare and shall provide healthcare
to all. This right does not restrict private practices.

$\quad$$\quad$This law provides healthcare opportunities to every individual no matter the
circumstances and is seen as a fundamental human right. This allows individuals to
receive medical services when in need. While the federal government offers affordable
healthcare, private practices may be opened and may be much higher in quality creating
winners and losers among wealth inequality. This is ranked towards the bottom of the
list because healthcare is a demand in our democracy and will appear even without a
government healthcare system. The quality of this natural system is likely to take
advantage of people and create winners and losers, that’s why healthcare was included in
the list at all.

$\quad$Article 1a-10) **Freedom of Information**

$\quad$$\quad$Federal and state agencies must disclose any information requested by anyone
unless under the following exemptions; personal privacy, national security, and law
enforcement. The federal and state government shall not withhold or misinterpret
requested information that falls outside the exceptions.

$\quad$$\quad$It is a citizen's right to know what their government is doing. Within this right,
citizens have the right to request information attained by the government and other
federal and state agencies. No individual is exempt from this right, however, information
requested cannot jeopardize the safety of an individual, personal privacy, national
security, and law enforcement. The government under no circumstance shall mislead this
information. This could create winners and losers with those who can submit a request
for information while others cannot. This is ranked near the bottom because although
freedom of information is good to provide information on what the government is
doing it is just not as important as other rights.

$\quad$Article 1a-11) **Freedom of Trade, Occupation, and Profession**

$\quad$$\quad$Every citizen has the right to choose their trade, occupation, or profession freely.
The practice of trade, occupation or profession may be subject to laws imposed in the
collective interest or restrictions that are inherent in a person’s own capabilities.

$\quad$$\quad$Freedom of trade, occupation, and profession grants individuals the right to
choose their career path based on their interests, and/or skills. Individuals may be
subject to laws imposed on the collective interest of the people, enabling certain
requirements to practice certain professions. These “laws imposed” could create winners
and losers based on the majority group making “collective interest or restrictions” laws
that silence or do not consider the minority group. This is ranked last on our list of
rights because it seems like an implied right that is already provided but we thought it
was important to specify.

### $\quad$II. Article 2 (Enforcement of Rights and Freedoms)

$\quad$Article 2a-1) **Ensured Protection Through the Constitution**

$\quad$$\quad$People whose rights or freedoms have been allegedly violated have the right,
either in person or through legally authorized representation, to complain to and have
that complaint promptly reviewed in a public hearing before an independent, impartial,
and competent judicial authority established by law. Any decision made by the judiciary
must be respected by all forms of government. The violators of these rights may face
fines, jail time, or termination if they have a job in government. All rights listed in the bill
of rights have supremacy over any new law or policy created.

### $\quad$III. Article 3 (Application of Rights and Freedoms in Government)

$\quad$Article 3a-1) **Application Towards Sub-Units of Government**

$\quad$$\quad$All rights will apply to all sub-units of governments to ensure consistency
throughout but are not limited to federal liberties and freedoms.

$\quad$$\quad$Applying all rights and freedoms in Government to Sub-Units allows for
consistency of rights and freedoms to be followed. This allows for all peoples to
understand rights and freedoms in all aspects of Government.

$\quad$Article 3a-2) **State Rights**

$\quad$$\quad$States reserve the right to offer further protection but may be subject to federal
review, therefore states also reserve the right to pass their own laws.
