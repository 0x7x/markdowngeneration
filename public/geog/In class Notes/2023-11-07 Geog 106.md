## Agriculture

### Neolithic Revolution

- Started to live collectively
- We began to domesticate plants and animals for food
	- This did not just occur in one place but spread around the world

- Farming and specialization leads to hierarchy (and more specialization). This then leads to technological innovation which then allowed agricultural innovation.
- The "crisis of feudalism" was the first truly global exchange network
- Exploration = Colonialism + Slavery






> - Much of the tropics are being cleared for the creation of products
> - The impact is hidden from us
> - Decrease in forested area
